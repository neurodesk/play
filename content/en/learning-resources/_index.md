  Neurodesk offers two types of learning resources to help you get started with neuroimaging analysis: 
  
  Tutorials are static, step-by-step guides that walk you through analyses using graphical user interfaces (GUIs). They include screenshots, detailed instructions, and visual documentation—perfect for beginners or those who prefer point-and-click workflows. 
  
  Examples are interactive computational notebooks that you can run, modify, and experiment with. These Jupyter notebooks contain executable code and are ideal for users who want to automate analyses, build reproducible workflows, or dive deeper into scripting-based neuroimaging. 
  
  Choose the format that best matches your learning style and experience level. Both resources use the same containerised neuroimaging tools available in Neurodesk. You can also contribute both tutorials and examples. 

### 1. Understand Neurodesk: 
Neurodesk is a flexible and scalable data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging. In the NeurodeskApp, it combines both computational notebooks and a graphical user interface. In this section, you will find learning resources for both of these tools. [More info](/docs/overview)

### 2. Choose Your Setup: 
Neurodesk can be used on various platforms including a local PC, High-Performance Computing (HPC), Cloud, and Google Colab. It supports Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. You can interact with it through a desktop interface, command line, container, or VSCode. Choose the setup that best suits your needs based on [this table](/content/en/Getting-Started/_index.md).

### 3. Follow the Instructions: 
Once you've chosen your setup, follow the instructions provided in the link. 

{{< alert title="For example" >}} if you're using Linux on a local PC with a desktop interface, you would follow the instructions at https://neurodesk.org/docs/getting-started/neurodesktop/linux/.
